# Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon (`the Stroop Effect`)

__i will use paired t test since i have one group take two experiment__

# conclusion

since the `p value` is smaller than type 1 error `0.05` that means the `t_value` more real than be not real
and the `t_value` is `8` so there is `statistically difference`

so we reject the null hypothesis and this meet my expectations that the means difference and std difference so t values will be more likely large
