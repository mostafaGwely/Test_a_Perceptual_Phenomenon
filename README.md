# Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon (`the Stroop Effect`)

I will use a paired t-test since I have one group take two experiment

# conclusion

since the `p-value` is smaller than type 1 error `0.05` that means the `t_value` more real than be not real

and the `t_value` is `8` so there is `statistically difference`



so we reject the null hypothesis and this meet my expectations that the means difference and std difference so t values will be more likely large
